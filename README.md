# Tech Challenge for Ultimate.ai

In this repository you can find my implementation of the tech challenge for Ultimate.ai. For this project, I used:

- Create React App or React Scripts to manage the project boilerplate.
- Prettier with a pre-commit hook for automatic code formatting.
- TypeScript to write self-documenting type-safe code.
- React Bootstrap for some common UI elements.
- CSS. Simple is good.

Nice to haves or things I would have done:

- Add a few tests with React Testing Library.
- Create a design system using SASS or another CSS abstractions.
- A library of UI components with Storybook.
- End-to-end tests with Cypress.
- Better responsivity, but it currently works nicely in small screens.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
